# Prototype_PlayerMovement



--- BUGS

Dash needs to be fixed. Probably some velocity needs to be reset before leaving state or entering state? some wall jump combos are weird


--- TODO LIST
Add more dungeon rooms

Chest that opens when the player interacts with it and it spawns coins/items when it is opened


At this pace I want to get started on some enemy's and setting up some of that stuff. 

Maybe make my own tileset???
